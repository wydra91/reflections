What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git directory and stores the nessecary metadata to begin tracking changes.
Note: You still need to run git commit in order to save your initial state.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is more like a "pending transactions" area that exists solely in the git metadata. It's
used to track what files are about to be committed. It allows you to work on multiple files, and separate them into separate
commits without too much hassle.
