When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Generally speaking, it would be good to do so if you are planning on working on the project from multiple computers, or if you have 
multiple people working on it.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's possible that you might make changes on the local repo, that would then be overwritten if you pulled.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are essentially "unlinked copies" of repos on GitHub, clones are linked copies, and branches are offshoots of the master branch that are still related to the repo.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I don't even really know, aside from the fact that it would make it easy to see what you have changed, compared to what was last online.
